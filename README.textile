h1. MapTracker - a Play! 2.0 demo

Use of Play! 2.0 (Java API) with Twitter Bootstrap, WebSockets, Akka and OpenLayers.

The purpose of this project is to show a moving vehicle on a map. The location of the vehicle is sent to the server through a REST call, and the connected users can see the vehicle moving in real-time on their map.
